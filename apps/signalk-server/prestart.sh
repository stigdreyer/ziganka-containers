# Signal K Server app-prestart hook (sourced by the generated framework prestart).
# OIDC is declarative now (routing.auth.mode: oidc): the framework provisions the
# client secret, writes the Authelia snippet, and appends SIGNALK_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
# /_ISSUER/_REDIRECT_URI to runtime.env. This hook keeps the Signal K-specific
# steps: the security.json bootstrap, external-URL advertising, the Ziganka fork's
# Docker-socket GID resolution, and the InfluxDB logging plugin.
#
# Ziganka fork of halos-marine-containers' signalk-server: dirkwa image, host
# Docker socket mounted into the container, per-host DOCKER_GID, ziganka- paths.
#
# The secret-file handling below (security.json, admin-password, the InfluxDB
# plugin config) is ported from upstream's TOCTOU-hardened rewrite
# (halos-org/halos-marine-containers, ref d4e0fa1806966f0c51f9620069153683f96d4e36).
# Our default-data/data/settings.json never shipped the broken gpsd pipeline
# upstream's migrate_gpsd_liner repairs, so that migration is not ported.

# --- secret files -----------------------------------------------------------
# security.json (admin hash + JWT signing key) and the InfluxDB token config are
# written by root into a directory this hook hands to uid 1000, so the container
# -- and any host process running as pi, the same uid -- can put something else
# at those names first.
#
# All of it happens in one python3 block, because the shell cannot express the
# constraints:
#
#   * chmod(2) always dereferences and has no --no-dereference, so converging a
#     mode is only safe as open(O_NOFOLLOW) + fchmod.
#   * `set -o noclobber` is NOT O_EXCL. Bash stats the path first and adds
#     O_EXCL only when that stat fails, so a symlink to a FIFO or a device node
#     is followed.
#   * Guarding named paths cannot cover a swapped *parent*, because every
#     syscall re-resolves the whole path. The parents are opened once here and
#     everything is *at-relative to those descriptors.
#   * The predicate is the file type, not "is a symlink": a directory, FIFO,
#     socket or device at one of these names has to be handled too.
#   * O_NOFOLLOW refuses a symlink but not a FIFO, and opening a FIFO to read
#     blocks until a writer appears -- for root as much as anyone. Reads add
#     O_NONBLOCK and check the type through the descriptor.
#
# Refusing to start is the answer when security.json cannot be made safe: an
# open Signal K is worse than an absent one. That licence is narrow. An abort
# the container can trigger on demand, or one caused by a fault that redirects
# nothing, is a permanent outage bought for nothing -- ExecStartPre gets five
# restarts before systemd stops trying.
#
# The token is read before the block so python needs no shell interpolation.
